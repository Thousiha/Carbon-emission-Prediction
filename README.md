Dataset:
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various attributes related to carbon emissions.
These attributes are likely features such as industrial production, energy consumption, population density, etc.

Model:
A deep learning model for carbon emission prediction has been developed and trained previously. The model is saved in the form of an HDF5 file named "model.h5".
TensorFlow and Keras are used for building and training the deep learning model.

Streamlit Web Application:
Streamlit is a Python library used for creating web applications with minimal code.Streamlit is designed to make it easy for data scientists and developers to create web applications for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning without the need for extensive web development experience.
  Key Features of Streamlit:
    Ease of Use: Streamlit provides a simple and intuitive API, allowing developers to create interactive web apps with just a few lines of Python code.
	Automatic UI Updates: Streamlit automatically updates the user interface (UI) whenever there is a change in the underlying data or code, eliminating the need for manual handling of UI  updates.
    Data Visualization: It supports the integration of various data visualization libraries, allowing users to create interactive plots and charts within the application.

Streamlit Web Application for "Emission Prediction App":
Title: The application is titled "Emission Prediction App," indicating that its primary purpose is to predict carbon emissions based on user-provided input.
User Interface (UI): The Streamlit app uses a sidebar for user interaction, featuring sliders for input features related to carbon emissions.
Predict Button: The "Predict" button in the sidebar triggers the prediction function, making it user-friendly by allowing predictions to be generated on-demand.
Display of Results: Predicted emission values are displayed in the app using Streamlit's st.subheader and st.write functions.
